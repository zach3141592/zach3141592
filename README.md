I'm a full stack engineer who loves building cool stuff and meeting cool people :)

My most recent project: </br> - app that allows people to practice their rizzabilities on AI personas </br> - 1000+ users so far

Other stuff I do: </br> - chess </br> - jazz </br> - basketball (i'm like LeBron if he was a foot shorter and korean)
